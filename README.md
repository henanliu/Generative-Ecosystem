# Generative-Ecosystem
Developed with Longtai Liao in 2018.



It is a python script run within Grasshopper for Rhino 3D.

We create a self-organized surface system that follows any surface and adjusts itself when its population drops down dramatically or is approaching convergence. Simple cellular geometries are created to be mapped into the system and to reflect the surviving states of each cell. As the color indicates,  every surviving cell has its distinct character and they would proudly say, if they can,  “We Made It!”.
